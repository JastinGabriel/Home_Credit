**Project Description:** Home Credit's Credit Score Prediction

**Challenge:** Home Credit currently uses various statistical and Machine Learning methods to predict customer creditworthiness. However, they want to unlock the full potential of their data to improve loan approval rates, minimize risk, and drive business growth.

**Objective:** This project aims to optimize Home Credit's credit score prediction model by:

  - Leveraging advanced Machine Learning techniques: Beyond traditional methods, explore algorithms like Random Forests and Logistic Regression for potentially higher accuracy and deeper insights.
  - Conducting rigorous data analysis: Thoroughly examine the existing data, identify patterns and trends, and address potential biases or data quality issues.
  - Developing targeted loan strategies: Tailor loan terms and conditions based on predicted risk profiles, optimizing repayment success and customer satisfaction.
  - Providing actionable recommendations: Clearly communicate insights and findings to inform data-driven business decisions and model improvements.
